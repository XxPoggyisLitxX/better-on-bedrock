# Better-on-Bedrock

## Add-On files for Better on Bedrock. Does not include in-development builds.

This Git-Repo will hold a version of Better on Bedrock that's being developed.
There will be commits in the official Discord Server. At a later date, these
"old versions" will be added to a different repo, not this one.

**It's not recommended to use code from this REPO as that code will be a WIP
(Work In Progress)** Final Builds are only released on the Discord Server.

NOTE:

- Changes made may not be permanent.
- Some stuff might not make the final cut.
